# Chocolatey Packages

This repo contains Chocolatey packages, both manually and automatically maintained.

* icons - Where you keep icon files for the packages. This is done to reduce issues when packages themselves move around.
* manual - where packages that are not automatic are kept.
* setup - items for prepping the system to ensure for auto packaging.

For setting up your own automatic package repository, please see [Automatic Packaging](https://chocolatey.org/docs/automatic-packages)
