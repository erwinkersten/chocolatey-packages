## Rio - Application Deployment Engine for Kubernetes

Rio is an Application Deployment Engine for Kubernetes that can be layered on top of any standard Kubernetes cluster.
Consisting of a few Kubernetes custom resources and a CLI to enhance the user experience, users can easily deploy services to Kubernetes and automatically get continuous delivery, DNS, HTTPS, routing, monitoring, autoscaling, canary deployments, git-triggered builds, and much more.
All it takes to get going is an existing Kubernetes cluster and the rio CLI.
