## k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s

k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker.
K3s is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances.
k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.
